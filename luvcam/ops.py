notes / todo:
- calibration img does not need aocs stuff --- create separate function?

- dt_pointing / dt_detumble: add option for dt in minutes or specific time in UTC

- add search for ra/deg for known objects?

- tests

- GRBBeta will/will not be illuminated by the Sun.

- GRBBeta lon,lat

- always put at least 1 sec between two mcr items

- create commands for data download (luvcam img + temp measurement)

- create commands for deleting luvcam + temp files (once downloaded!)

- documentation

# Calibration LUVCam image (512x512 px) typically needs 2 passes to download.
# The drops can be either started manually at the beginning of each pass,
# or, more conveniently, they can be scheduled for later passes via minicron.
# The exact minicron commands will be implemented in later version of this tool.
# For now, you can get the minicron commands in the SatOp after you log to 10.42.1.53.
# Before each "grb getf" command, change time to that of the pass when you want 
# it to be downloaded. Each part should be downloaded during different pass.

# part 1/2
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
m grb getf 1 -u -i -1 -w 8 -p 200 {filename}.raw -f 0 -s 262144 -n 3000

# part 2/2
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
m grb getf 1 -u -i -1 -w 8 -p 200 {filename}.raw -f 262144 -s 262272 -n 3000


# !IMPORTANT! In all output "cli 14 ..." commands for download of LUVCam images,
# we need to manually change "7" to "1". 
# Example:
# We want to download part of 26d10a.raw file during pass which begins 
# at 2026-04-11 17:06:00 UTC. Copy following two lines to SatOp:

2026-04-11 17:06:00
m grb getf 1 -u -i -1 -w 8 -p 200 26d10a.raw -f 0 -s 250112 -n 3000

# You will get following output:

# After all files are successfully downloaded, we delete them:
